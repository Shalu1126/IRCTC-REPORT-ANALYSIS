# IRCTC-REPORT-ANALYSIS
The IRCTC Report Analysis dashboard in Excel visualizes booking trends, seat availability, confirmation rates, and passenger demographics. It highlights issues like unconfirmed tickets despite available seats and compares booking channels, quotas, and travel classes to improve transparency and decision-making.
This Excel-based interactive dashboard presents a detailed analytical view of IRCTC ticket booking data, helping to uncover operational inefficiencies and user experience challenges. The dashboard is organized into multiple visual segments that enable users to explore data across dimensions such as seat availability, passenger demographics, travel class, booking channel, and confirmation status.

Key Components:
Seat Availability Filter (More than 100 Seats):
A slicer allows users to filter data based on whether trains had more than 100 available seats.
A bar chart visualizes the number of confirmed vs. not confirmed bookings under each category, highlighting potential inconsistencies in ticket confirmation despite high seat availability.
